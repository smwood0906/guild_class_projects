        <h4> Background </h4>
        <p> I recently moved to Oregon after living in <a href="http://www.traveljuneau.com/"> Juneau, AK</a> for the
            last ten years.
            My husband grew up in Bend, OR, and after one visit, it didn't take much convincing on his part for me to
            consider moving here.
            Although I miss the wildness of Alaska, I am
            really loving the friendliness of Oregon, and I have been busy having new adventures - Oregon-style!</p>

        <h4> Career & Education </h4>
        <p> I have been an Academic Advisor for the past 5 years. First, at the University of Alaska Southeast, and
            currently,
            for the College of Engineering at Oregon State University. Prior to Academic Advising I worked for the
            Alaska Department
            of Fish and Game developing internships and recruiting top-notch students nationwide.
        </p>
        <p> I received a Bachelor of Arts degree of the College of Saint Benedict in 2006. I love to learn, and since
            completing my
            undergraduate, I have continued to pursue graduate work in various areas of interest. Although I have not
            completed a graduate degree,
            I have completed coursework in Public Administration, Counseling, and Education.

        <h4> Aspirations </h4>
        <p> Although I love the interpersonal interactions and daily problem solving involved in my current career, I am
            excited and ready
            to change my career path! Through my decade of work experience I have learned that I enjoy (and have
            strengths in) strategic thinking,
            analysis, and logic. After exploring careers that would allow me to use my strengths, I discovered
            programming and after a few lessons
            on CodeAcademy I was hooked.
        </p>
        <p> I am currently a student at PDX CodeGuild, learning fullstack web development. So far we have delved into
            Python, and are beginning
            our work in HTML and CSS. I am so enthralled by this new topic and amazed that after only a month, I can
            write working programs!
            My goal is to make a complete career change and become a fulltime software developer once I have completed
            this Bootcamp.
            I am counting the days to my new career!</p>

        <h4> Interests & Fun Stuff </h4>
        <p> I love anything and everything that can be done outside! In Alaska I spent most of my free time hiking,
            skiing, ice climmbing,
            taking care of my old chocolate lab, Elway, and camping on the beach. Since moving to Oregon I am finding
            new adventures with gardening,
            raising chickens, and searching for snow to ski in.</p>
        <p> I have traveled solo to Africa and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro,, canoed for 30 days down the Yukon River,
            taught on the Navajo
            reservation in New Mexico, lived abroad in New Zealand, and had many other exciting adventures. My
            philosophy is that
            there are so many adventures waiting out there for me, if I wait around to try something, I'll never get
            through them all. </p>
